hey team , wanted to explain my fixes.

1.firstly when looking at the "procurment" model I could see that the "createdAt" field is a date object. which means it doesn't need any casting,
  when I looked at the data coming from the backend I noticed that the "createdAt" field is called "cretedat" (lowecase 'a'). At that point I can either change the model 
  and the db and every other mention of createdAt to cretedat or, when fetching the rows I will map them and change the "createdat" field to "createdAt".  
  I chose to map the rows when I am returning the data. 
  In a real scenario I would opt for the second option and to refactor it, asking the team leader which case to use and to make sure it doesn;t impact other services or functionalities. 
  The mapping is inefficient and in large scale it would flop.
2.I chose mockapi.io to create an inventory resource and put some mock data inside, in the end I creted an endpoint of localhost:3002/api/procurments/inventoryLevels when the get request
  is sent that endpoint will return the relevant "inventory" data.*used axios for the requests.  
4.I implemented the minQuantiy filter by integrating the param into the url (for example : http://localhost:3002/api/procurements/filter-by-quantity?minQuantity=70). I sent those requests
  via postman to see the results. I sent an SQL query to the DB and added a condition using the keyword "WHERE". I did the same with filter-by-status.
